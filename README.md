# First attempt - MVP


## TAGS

### v0.1

Scafolded a vanilla js vite project and I wanted to make sure I can fetch and show video thumbnails with posters. We fetch data and use map function to simply create a video element for every element in the array and then add it to element's innerHTML. Cool method for quickly creating markup without adding a framework.

## Task

This is a Javascript Developer Technical Task. My task was to create an application that will serve a feed with posts that are based around videos. API Specification was provided as an Apiary document. It was required to at least implement fetching and displaying of the feed. 

Good places to showcase skill set:
- make the video
play/pause in fullscreen, 
- animate actions
- add share 
- prepare for deep linking
- make rating fluid and animated.

Good places to showcase knowledge:
- Good setup documentation
- TypeScript
- Clean VCS history
- Having VCS
- Robustness of input and output parameters
- CLEAN, layer architecture, MV***

Other:
- design was not provided and it wasn't really important for the task. 
- I was allowed to use any tools as I find fit.
- have fun doing it!
